This document is the strategic roadmap for the FileSender Programme as established in The Commons Conservancy foundation.

It needs to be read in tandem with 


If you want to add something to the roadmap, want to discuss priorities and 
cost estimates or have other roadmap suggestions, please either:
	* preferred method: create a governance issue ticket in the governance repository

# FileSender Vision

* FileSender aims to be<br>
 a widely deployed platform <br>
 enabling anyone <br>
to easily and securely transfer <br>
files of any size <br>
from any person or machine to any person or machine. *

FileSender explicitly targets mass-usage and is built to service the 99% 
of users who have better things to do with their time than figuring out 
how to do large file transfer 


# FileSender governance and legal home
The FileSender Programme is an open collaborative software 
development effort with community governance provided 
by the FileSender Board of Directors.

FileSender’s legal-administrative home is with The Commons Conservancy, 
a Netherlands-based foundation for creating and fostering a technology commons in Europe. 

The Commons Conservancy is a multi-tenant “foundation-as-a-service” provider hosting 
virtual not-for-profit organisations in the field of open source software, 
design and hardware development.

# The FileSender software product 

To implement the vision the FileSender Programme produces open source software 
which can be installed by anyone. This allows any organisation or individual to 
spin up a FileSender service for their community, using the operational model 
that best fits their context and purposes. 


# The FileSender roadmap ambition

The roadmap supports the vision by ensuring continued support, maintenance, and 
further development of the FileSender open source software with features so 
relevant that the product is and remains widely deployed in the Target Groups


# Target Groups

Currently the main target group for the FileSender platform is 
the Research & Education sector. FileSender is known to be used in other sectors. 

Future target groups being considered are government, health, NGOs, 
commercial service providers.


#Funding strategy

Based on experience gathered since 2009, FileSender depends on paid-for contributions, 
supplemented with in-kind contributions.

FIleSender’s funding strategy is:
	* large installed base allows sharing the development cost over many at low support 
		cost per contributor (financial or in-kind contribution)
	* low financial/other contribution per contributor


#Sourcing strategy
To support our strategic aim of continuous software production and community development (as opposed to start - bigger effort - stop), we prefer long-term engagements for key roles. It takes time to learn the code, the organisational context and the rhythm of the community.

Examples of such key roles are:
lead developer
community lead
open source secretariat
managing a public demonstrator installation

Short term engagements can be used for:
specific, not continuously occurring tasks that typically are well (enough) standardised to capture in a simple description of work.
tasks requiring specialised skills and knowledge we can not or do not want to maintain in the Programme
tasks that require a big one-off effort on a specific area we don’t have resources for

Examples of such tasks are:
code security audits, crypto security audits
UI design
setting up te CI infrastructure

Currently the majority of effort spent on FileSender is through paid-for contributions, complemented by in-kind contributions. 

Note that some tasks occur with steady intervals, e.g. security audits have been contributed as in-kind contributions by SURF over the years, though the firms used vary. We prefer such repeated in-kind contributions to be governed by MoUs. This allows for smooth integration of the in-kind contributions in the FileSender effort. It also gives predictability over time to the contributions, especially in times when the person responsible at the contributor’s organisation leaves.  

Long term engagements are typically organised through MoU-relationships between the person(s) engaging and the NLnet foundation. Short term engagements often take the form of contracting.
